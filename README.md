# Chess Recognition Problem

### Problem Statement

The problem of identifying the configuration of chess pieces from an image of a physical chessboard is often referred to as chess recognition. The ability of a computer to recognize the chess pieces on a chessboard is the first step to developing an intelligent system that can play chess, can solve chess problems/puzzles, and can perform chess analysis.

The goal of my project is to recognize the chess pieces and their respective position on the chessboard which can be described in a structured format such as Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN) which is compatible with various chess engines. I also added an extra layer of interpretation which takes the generated FEN as input and outputs if there are any potential attacks (checks) and also spots illegal chess positions.

### Dataset

The dataset has 100000 images of randomly generated chess positions of 5–15 pieces (2 kings and 3–13 pawns/pieces). All images are 400 by 400 pixels.
